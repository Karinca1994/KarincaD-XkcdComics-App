# KarincaD-XkcdComics-App

So this project wanted me to have this on the app:

•	browse through the comics

•	see the comic details, including its description,

•	search for comics by the comic number as well as text,

•	get the comic explanation

•	favorite the comics, which would be available offline too,

•	send comics to others,

•	get notifications when a new comic is published,

•	support multiple form factors.

This is another try for my last failure on the app, i really hope this time it works, i was using the wrong api, so thats why i had so much truble running the app. Also last time i writed this raport in norwegian, so i wanted to write it in english this time..

before I started coding I made a mind map, a category map and some simple paper sketches by hand,
I have also written down by hand everything I have struggled with and achieved so I learn from my own mistakes.
I also created a simple app design on adobe XD.

I had alot of challechings fixing up the old app, so i had to start a new project... in the end i had to switch the api and made another new code, and the whole site failed, so i had to start over again for two days ago... but it is really worth the struggles :), i learned alot from it

I used courses from Linkendin, tutorials from youtube,
looked at: https://developer.apple.com/, also at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/ and several ways websites/google
to solve the code problems and learning more about swiftUI

I tried to make search to work but the filter and api crashed , so i putted that aside so since i didnt have the time to fix it, same as Explanation page, I used another api(the one i first started using) and this api was causing alot of bugs too, so i had to put it aside...

I actually did not expect this task to be so challenging as I have done a lot of this before
on react/next.js, but it took me by surprise! Of course I thought it was a lot of fun
and exiting, learned a lot since i always had on my checklist to learn calling apis in swiftUI, so this was really usefull task and im exited to make more apps with another apis/subjects!


all in all, I love the Swift UI and it was incredibly educational and I can't wait to make more apps! :D
